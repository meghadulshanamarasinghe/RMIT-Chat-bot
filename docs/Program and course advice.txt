Program and course advice Which courses should I choose? You can find your program structure in Enrolment Online along with information to help you with your course selection. If you need further assistance, you can contact us (see contact methods across). Which courses are available in spring, summer and flexible term? You can find our Spring, Summer and Flexible term courses listed with delivery dates to determine if any of these are suitable for you. Some overseas short-term study programs also run in semester break periods. What should I do if I would like to change programs? Current and recent RMIT local students can submit an internal application for a new program. I am currently studying a double degree but would like to change to a single degree, how can I do that? You are welcome to apply to change programs. Please search for the program you are interested in via our study with us webpage and apply to RMIT as a local or international student. Can I have a program plan created for my studies? Our teams can create a plan for your program (also known as a program map) and send this to you via email.
