You should learn to analyse and design fairly complex real-life systems, working as teams. The project based approach used requires you to review and refine your design iteratively based on regular feedback from staff. You are also made aware of current software engineering standards and processes. You are also taught to consider qualitative aspects including maintainability, extensibility, reusability and robustness in every stage of the software-engineering life-cycle. At the end of the course you should be able to combine top-down and bottom-up approaches to software design and choose the most appropriate process considering the underlying
